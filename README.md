# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Overview
This project is a Python-based interactive simulator that implements various CPU scheduling algorithms. It provides detailed visualizations through Gantt charts, performance metrics, and user-friendly input mechanisms to explore scheduling concepts effectively.

## Features
- Implementation of major CPU scheduling algorithms:
  - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF) - Non-preemptive and Preemptive
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Priority Scheduling - Non-preemptive and Preemptive
- Gantt chart visualization for better understanding of process execution timelines.
- Performance metrics such as average Turnaround Time (TAT) and Waiting Time (WT).
- User-friendly menu-driven interface.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later
- Required Libraries:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
